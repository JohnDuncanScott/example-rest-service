# ExampleRestService
This project showcases a simple REST service. Mainly a learning project to put together something fullstack with best practices, as far as possible.

If you enjoy this project, please consider [:hearts: buying me a beer :beer: :hearts:](https://johnduncanscott.github.io/personal-website/#/tip) and starring :star: the project. My [**personal website**](http://johnduncanscott.github.io/personal-website/) for the curious.

# Tech rationales
* Build system
  * **Maven** - Mature build system, can find a lot of tutorials for it,
  have used it for personal projects
* Backend service
  * **Java** - still popular and versatile. For C#, Blazor looks
  like an interesting competitor, but doesn't use JavaScript, and want to use
  JavaScript
  * <https://rollbar.com/blog/spring-boot-vs-spring-mvc-differences-and-when-to-use-each/>
    * Go with **Spring Boot** for speed
* Frontend framework
  * <https://www.keycdn.com/blog/frontend-frameworks>
  * **React** is hard to pickup due to inconsistent project docs
  * **Vue** has excellent docs and tutorials, and is easy to learn
  * **Angular** has a steep learning curve
  * Conclusion: **Vue** should be best for quick prototyping due to its
  learning curve and its popularity
* Styling
  * **Bootstrap** has good docs and is robust, plus it's more versatile
  * **Vuetify** follows Material Design, so doesn't fit all applications
  * **Quasar** has high complexity but has a lot of inbuilt best practices,
  also follows Material Design. Built by 1 person

    * **Bootstrap** specific:
      * [How does Bootstrap 5 Spacing work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IBbewitYxA)
   * Conclusion: For quick prototyping and flexibility, **Bootstrap** seems best choice
* Frontend
  * As a result of picking **Vue** and **Bootstrap**, there are more options:
    * **Bootstrap-Vue** (combines them, removing jQuery)
      * <https://bootstrap-vue.org/>
      * Good docs, good for beginners, flexible, popular
      * However, don't have experience with either, so combining both at once will probably
      be high mental load
    * **Vue** + **Bootstrap v5** (v5 has jQuery removed, so 2 work together nicely now)
      * <https://dev.to/codeply/using-bootstrap-5-with-vue-js-5fnp>

      * <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65547199/using-bootstrap-5-with-vue-3>
      * **Note:** Bootstrap v5 is in Beta. Normally wouldn't use this for prod
      but for prototyping this is ok
    * Conclusion: Go with plain **Vue** + **Bootstrap v5** for styling. As I'm new to
    both frameworks, working with them independently first is a better intro. Migrating
    to Bootstrap-Vue later (if even needed) should be reasonably simple
* Summary:
  * Build system: **Maven**
  * Backend: **Java** + **Spring Boot**
  * Frontend: **Vue** + **Bootstrap v5**
  * Tutorial: <https://www.springboottutorial.com/spring-boot-vue-full-stack-crud-maven-application>
    * Errata
      * The GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/in28minutes/spring-boot-vuejs-fullstack-examples/tree/master/spring-boot-crud-full-stack) seems mostly correct (but also has a few mistakes, like not updating the frontend service port), but if you're following the instructions then the below points should help (also one of the first commits in my repo has this working fully)
      * "Implementing Routing" section - 3 components should be:
        * `./components/ListCoursesComponent`
        * `./components/ListCoursesComponent`
        * `./components/CourseComponent`
      * "Adding Add button to Course Listing Page" section:
        * `this.$router.push(``/course/-1``);` should be `this.$router.push(``/courses/-1``);` (should be plural)
      * "Adding Validation using Formik" section:
        * `validate(values)` should be `validateAndSubmit(e)`
        * `<div class="alert alert-warning" v-bind:key="index" v-for="(error, index) in errors"></div>` should be `<div class="alert alert-warning" v-bind:key="index" v-for="(error, index) in errors">{{error}}</div>` (the `{{error}}` is missing)

# Tooling
* Backend - IntelliJ Community Edition
* Frontend - Visual Studio Code with:
  * Markdown All in One
  * Markdown Preview Enhanced
  * Vetur (Vue plugin)
* Browser
  * <https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools> (doesn't work in Edge, Chrome is fine)

# Instructions
## Requirements
* Install [Java Development Kit 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) for your platform
* Install [nodejs v15.14.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  
## Backend
* Open folder **backend_java_springboot** in IntelliJ and let it import the Maven project
* Edit parent pom.xml and change **build.target.directory** to a build directory of your choosing
* Compile the **service** module
* Go to Run -> Edit Configurations -> Add **Application** and set the following:
  * Main class: `com.idm.service.ServiceApplication`
  * Use classpath of module: `service`
* Run the configuration you just created
* Open `http://localhost:8080/packages` in any browser to see a list of packages available

## Frontend
* `cd frontend_vue_bootstrap`
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm run serve`
* Open `http://localhost:8081/` to see the Home page. You won't see any packages unless the backend is up and running

# Architecture
## Backend
* `assemblers` - Build models that are surfaced to client via REST responses
* `controllers` - Standard Spring controllers, one for each API
* `models`
  * `data` - Internal POJOs
  * `resources` - Client facing POJOs
* `services` - Spring @Service classes, assemble backend data into internal POJOs
* `adapters` - Clients for talking to dependencies
### API
* `/packages`
  * GET - returns all packages
  * GET `/{id}` - returns single package
  * GET `/{id}/products` - returns products for a package
  * GET `/{packageId}/products/{productId}` - returns product in a package
  * DELETE `/{id}` - deletes a package
  * PUT `/{id}` - updates a package. Name and Description are updateable, other changes are currently ignored
  * POST - creates a new package with 0 products. Id will be generated automatically
* `/products`
  * GET - returns all products
  * GET `/{id}` - returns single product

## Frontend
* `components` - Vue components, 1 for each view. Header is global. ...View components are customer facing. ...Edit components are internal Admin views
* `service`
  * `BasketService` - Mock service for storing basket contents
  * `ProductPackageService` - Working service that calls Backend
  * `UserPersonalisationService` - Mock service for storing currency selection
* `events.js` - Constants for events used
* `routes.js` - Navigation setup

# Known issues
## Backend
* TODO comments mention most limitations
* When the server is run for the first time, it takes a few seconds to get the Product information. The frontend will look blank for a few seconds and then react
* There are no JavaDocs
* Code coverage limits not defined but unit test coverage is reasonably high
* Thread safety has not been tested

## Frontend
* The styling works for desktop for customer facing pages. However, they do not look nice when resizing, although the pages are functional - need to add proper breakpoints to make this work for mobile
* Code duplication in certain areas, needs some refactoring to create smaller components rather than just focusing on each View individually
* Cannot add products to a package in Admin mode
* Cannot change prices of products in Admin mode
* No security around Admin mode
* No double-check when deleting packages
* Does not have full accessibility (i.e. aria tags for everything)
* Does not have localisation (e.g. currency delimiter does not change to match currency)
* Cross browser compatibility unknown
* Discounting and Basket storing are done on the client side as a shortcut. Client should be doing as little logic as possible
* Should be more proper JavaScript classes for some of the modelling
* Revisiting Home by changing the URL in the browser will result in loss of cart information. Pressing Back works fine. You can use this bug to reset your cart to start a different test case
* No automated tests. Needs things like Selenium tests to make sure things are displayed correctly
* Promises should have error logging
* Long strings will not truncate if they cannot wrap

# Manual test cases
## Home
* Search

    * Home view
    * Package details view
  * Check Currency selection triggers price and symbol changes in:
    * Home view
    * Package details view
    * Basket view
* State
  * Check navigating forwards and backwards between Home view, Package details view and Basket view remembers Currency selection
## Admin (reachable via Admin button in Header)

## Exploratory testing
* Open Developer tools and navigate around website, keeping an eye out for interesting logs and errors

# Steps to productionize
## Backend
* ExchangeRateClientAdapterImpl
  * Add unit tests
  * Query common currencies all in 1 request to avoid multiple trips
  * Move access key to a secure secrets store (e.g. [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)) (or at least a props file)
  * Create proper model for API response
  * Don't swallow all exceptions
* ProductClientAdapterImpl
  * Add unit tests
  * Inject ObjectMapper
  * Move cache to parent service, doesn't belong in adapter. Also use proper cache with TTL (e.g. [Guava cache](https://www.baeldung.com/guava-cache))
  * Move user name and password to a secure secrets store (e.g. [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)) (or at least a props file)
* ProductPackageClientAdapterImpl
  * Move product package definitions to a database and read / write using [Spring Data JPA + Hibernate](https://www.baeldung.com/the-persistence-layer-with-spring-and-jpa) or similar. Use auto-incrementing id for product package id
* ProductPackageResourceAssembler
  * Add full unit tests
  * Replace "@Nullable ProductPackageInstant originalProductPackageInstant" with Optional
  * Fix self link with param hack properly
* ProductController
  * Make HATEOS / HAL compliant
  * Use different model for return values
* ProductPackageController
  * Setup proper error page
  * Inject ProductPackageResourceAssembler
  * Replace optional params with Optionals
  * Auto-convert currency params to Currency instances
* Models
  * Add unit tests
  * Check backend and frontend validation matches up
* ExchangeRateServiceImpl
  * Use proper cache with TTL (e.g. [Guava cache](https://www.baeldung.com/guava-cache))
  * If backup currency conversion were to be kept, this would be more maintainable as a Map rather than a switch statement. Already have a cache, so could just populate with defaults
* ProductPackageServiceImpl
  * Use Optional rather than returning null, would make API much cleaner
  * Separate out price conversions to a different class
* ProductServiceImpl
  * Use Optional rather than returning null, would make API much cleaner
  * Should be using a DTO and not leaking the Product model higher up the stack
* General
  * Number of packages will grow, so should use paging properly in REST API - [PagedResourcesAssembler](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21346387/how-to-correctly-use-pagedresourcesassembler-from-spring-data)
  * Packages and Products should have an audit history and should be able to rollback to a previous version
  * Use constructor injection where missing (`@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Inject))`) (missing this in the adapters for example)
  * Check using final where appropriate (not using it enough at the moment)
  * JavaDocs for all the classes
  * Add proper trackable metric counters
  * Where appropriate, use something like [MapStruct](https://stackabuse.com/guide-to-mapstruct-in-java-advanced-mapping-library/) for DTO mapping. Also see [performance of mapping frameworks](https://www.baeldung.com/java-performance-mapping-frameworks)
  * Convert money handling to use [org.javamoney](https://www.baeldung.com/java-money-and-currency)
  * Auto-generate documentation using [Spring REST Docs](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-rest-docs)
  * Enforce code coverage thresholds
  * Enable style checks (CheckStyle)
  * Enable static analysis checks (FindBugs)
  * Add functional tests (headless + tailess tests)
  * Add integration tests
  * Add performance tests (soak and load)
  * Check G1 GC is being used
  * Full CI/CD system out of scope :)

## Frontend
* BasketView
  * Clicking on a basket item should take you to the details for it
* ProductPackageEdit
  * Secure editing functionality
  * Move "new" to constant
* ProductPackagesEdit
  * Remove redundant ".then();"
  * Move "new" to constant
  * Delete should have a warning dialog
* ProductPackagesView
  * Move search functionality to backend. Although it works for a small number of items like this, really the search param should be passed to the backend. Also need paging. To reduce the load on the backend, search should be a positive confirmation rather than the dynamic searching that currently happens
  * Change case-insensitive search to use toUpperCase instead of toLowerCase to avoid round-tripping problems in countries like Turkey <https://garygregory.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/java-lowercase-conversion-turkey/>
* BasketService
  * This is a hack to keep basket state. Would likely be a whole service that included handling purchasing. This API would either fit in there or if warranted would be its own microservice. This type of data is more suited to a NoSQL database where we want high availability (e.g. DynamoDb which is actually [used for Amazon Cart](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/the-dynamo-paper))
* UserPersonalisationService
  * This a hack to keep user's preferred options. Would likely be its own microservice that kept track of all forms of user preferences
* General
  * JavaScript
    * Add error functions to promises where appropriate
    * Create proper types where interacting with the APIs using ES6 class functionality
    * Add more documentation
    * Move currency symbol and how to display to backend to reduce logic in client
    * Add proper trackable metric counters
  * CSS
    * Use [SASS or LESS](https://templeton.io/less-vs-sass-scss-why-which/) to create cleaner and more modular stylesheets
  * Vue
    * Check Vue best practice documentation to make sure it's being followed
    * Componentize some of the common buttons rather than re-declaring them
    * Check for and fix any alignment issues
  * Automated testing
    * Add unit tests
    * Enable JSLint
    * Selenium UI tests
    * Performance / Responsiveness tests
  * Safety
    * Ensure strict mode is activated
    * Replace var with let - [var vs. let](https://www.educba.com/javascript-var-vs-let/)
    * Switch to TypeScript
  * Security
    * Would of course need a login for user
    * Admin website should be completely independent to retail website
  * Performance
    * Use Audit functionality in Dev Tools to assess website
    * Make sure text compression is enabled
    * Enable minification
    * No images in this project, but you'd also make sure the correct image sizes were being used
  * Localisation
    * Check time formats, money formats, etc.
    * Check no hardcoded user facing strings - should only use constants that map to localised values. Can also use [pseudolocalisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudolocalization) to help detect problems
  * Compatibility
    * Check compatibility across browsers
    * Check breakpoints for site to ensure displays fine on mobile
    * Check on selection of real devices as a safety check (can use some kind of device farm, e.g. [AWS Device Farm](https://aws.amazon.com/device-farm/))
  * Accessibility
    * Check accessibility - aria tags, use screen reader to tab through and check it makes sense
    * Use [colour contrast tool](https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html) to check colours picked are good 
    * Check [colour blindness](http://www.particletree.com/features/interfaces-and-color-blindness)
    * Check [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/glance/)
    * Use something like [NoCoffee](https://accessgarage.wordpress.com/2013/02/09/458/) to test the website
